==Abstract==

This DIP defines a MIME (RFC 2046) Media Type for Dogecoin payment
protocol message files. These vary slightly from the MIME types
defined in BIP0070, in that they use the "vnd.doge.payment"
subtree. These MIME types are to be submitted to IANA for registry
when formal standards have been prepared, as per RFC 6838 section
3.2

==Specification==

The MIME type used for Dogecoin payment protocol messages are:

{|
| Message || Type/Subtype
|-
| PaymentRequest || application/vnd.doge.payment.request
|-
| Payment || application/vnd.doge.payment.payment
|-
| PaymentACK || application/vnd.doge.payment.ack
|}
