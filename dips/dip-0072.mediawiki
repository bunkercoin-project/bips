==Abstract==

This DIP describes an extension to the dogecoin: URI scheme (DIP 21) to
support the payment protocol (DIP 70). This is derived from BIP0072,
and modifies the MIME type in the "Accept" header example.

==Specification==

Dogecoin client software MUST include a suitable "Accept" HTTP header
in all HTTP requests. Format of the "Accept" header is defined in
RFC 2616. MIME types are defined in DIP0071.
